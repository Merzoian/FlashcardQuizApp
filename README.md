# 📚 Flashcard Quiz App

A simple and interactive web app that allows users to create, view, flip, and delete flashcards for studying. Flashcards are stored in the browser using `localStorage`, so your data stays even if you close or refresh the page.

## ✅ What I Learned

- DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript
- Handling user input and storing data with `localStorage`
- Building responsive UIs using Flexbox
- Planning, organizing, and documenting a full web project

## 🧪 Learning Strategies

### What Worked:
- Breaking the project into small tasks and testing after each one.
- Using comments and console logs for debugging.
- Focusing on functionality before design.

### What Didn’t Work:
- Spending time trying to perfect styles too early.
- Trying to write too much at once without testing in between.

### Improvements for Next Module:
- Set short daily goals and track progress.
- Use GitHub issues or a task list to organize work.
