# 📚 Flashcard Quiz App

A simple and interactive web app that allows users to create, view, flip, and delete flashcards for studying. Flashcards are stored in the browser using `localStorage`, so your data stays even if you close or refresh the page.

## 🔍 Overview

This project was created as part of a learning sprint to practice JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and browser storage. The app is clean, responsive, and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Flashcards are saved in the browser using `localStorage`.
- Users can flip the card to reveal the answer.
- Navigation buttons allow moving between cards.
- Add/Delete operations update the saved flashcards in real-time.

## 💡 Stretch Features (if completed)

 
 In this version of the Flashcard Quiz App, I focused on completing the full base functionality.
 
 I did explore advanced concepts for a beginner project:

I implemented card flipping animations using CSS and JavaScript, which involved working with transform and backface-visibility, simulating a 3D flip effect.

I also added deletion functionality and persistent storage using localStorage, so users can manage their flashcards across browser sessions—this went beyond just displaying or adding cards.

If I were to expand further, possible stretch challenges could include:

Organizing flashcards into categories (like subjects or decks).

Adding quiz mode (multiple choice or typed answer).

Syncing flashcards with a cloud database (e.g., Firebase).

## ✅ What I Learned

- DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript
- Handling user input and storing data with `localStorage`
- Building responsive UIs using Flexbox
- Planning, organizing, and documenting a full web project

---

## 🧪 Learning Strategies

### What Worked:
- Breaking the project into small tasks and testing after each one.
- Using comments and console logs for debugging.
- Focusing on functionality before design.

### What Didn’t Work:
- Spending time trying to perfect styles too early.
- Trying to write too much at once without testing in between.

### Improvements for Next Module:
- Set short daily goals and track progress.
- Use GitHub issues or a task list to organize work.
